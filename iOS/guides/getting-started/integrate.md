## Integration

There are three ways to integrate PDFNet with an app: manually, using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/), and using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

The manual download includes sample projects and source code for the UI framework, the while the package manager methods include only the framework binaries.

All three methods require a [trial lisence key](https://www.pdftron.com/pdfnet/mobile/request_trial.html) (or a commercial key), so please make sure you have one ready before proceeding.

### Manual Integration


1. If you have not already done so, please [obtain a trial license key](https://www.pdftron.com/pdfnet/mobile/request_trial.html) (or have a copy of your commerical key ready), which will be needed to intialize PDFNet.
2. Download the PDFNet DMG from the link provided in the trial email.
3. Copy
4. Script
5. PDNet initialize
