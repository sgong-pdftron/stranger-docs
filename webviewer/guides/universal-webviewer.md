title: Universal WebViewer
---
By converting a wide range of document formats into a web optimized [XPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_XML_Paper_Specification) file, called XOD, the WebViewer is able to deliver consistent results in viewing different document types.

The XOD conversion component comes in two forms so you can choose the one that suits your deployment, requirements and licensing needs. Additionally with the support of PDFNet's virtual printer driver, any document type that can be printed to a printer can be converted to a XOD file.

### PDFNet SDK with WebViewer Add-on
With this option, you get the benefit of using PDFNet SDK on your server. Essentially you would be doing your own XOD conversions on your server with PDFNet.

You can also use more advanced features: e.g. apply your own watermark to all converted documents, add/remove pages to converted documents, merge annotations back to the original PDF. This gives you the most flexibility and control over your documents.

### DocPub Command-line Converter
With this option, you run the conversions with a command-line tool. This works best if you have a static set of documents you want to convert in a batch, and upload to a server all at once.
