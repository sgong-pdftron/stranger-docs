title: Run the samples
---
The [WebViewer samples](https://www.pdftron.com/webviewer/demo/samples.html) are hosted on pdftron.com but they can also be run locally from your development server.

### Run on dev server
The samples are included in the [latest WebViewer download package](https://www.pdftron.com/webviewer/download.html).

1. Unzip the download package and copy the folder to your server.

2. Assuming you've copied it to the root of your server you can navigate to [localhost/WebViewer/samples.html](http://localhost/WebViewer/samples.html).
    - If you don't already have a local dev server this MDN guide shows [how to set one up](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server).
    - You will not be able to run the samples from the file system (e.g. double clicking samples.html) because of browser security restrictions.

3. Use the buttons at the top of the page to toggle between PDF/Office samples and XOD (Universal) samples. Most of the samples are the same but there are a few PDF specific samples and a few XOD specific ones.

4. Click on any of the sample links to run them in the browser.
