title: Headers
---

## Rules

* Use `#` for syntax.
* Use headings from `H2` to `H5` (no `H1`).
* Use sentence case ("Document viewing" instead of "Document Viewing").
* Do NOT use duplicate headers in a single markdown - each header string must be unique within the file.

### Example

```
## H2 for first-level sections

### and H3 for second-level sections

#### maybe H4 and H5 for third-level and fourth-level

##### but please avoid using headers H4 and H5 as much as possible
```
