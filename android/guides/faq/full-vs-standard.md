## Which PDFNet library is for me?

PDFNet library comes in two versions: standard and full.

In order to help our customers to create applications with a smaller APK size, the standard version omits a number of features such as:

- Convert, Optimizer, Redactor, Flattener, DocumentPreviewCache, ReflowProcessor classes;
- PDF/A validation/conversion;
- Converting PDF pages to TIFF and PNG formats (i.e., PDFDraw will not work when using these formats).

Rendering speed and quality are the same for both versions of the library.
