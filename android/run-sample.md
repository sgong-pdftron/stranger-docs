Simple Reader is an all-in-one document reader and PDF editor. In addition to PDF files, it also supports viewing of many file extensions such as `.docx`, `.doc`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.md`, `.cbz` and various image formats. It allows stream conversion of these non-pdf documents to PDF format so you can view the document while conversion happens. In this app, you can read, annotate, sign, share and fill in PDF forms.

Complete Reader has everything in Simple Reader, plus file browsers for local and SD card files. It has example for how you can implement recent and favorite files. It also demonstrates how to use document thumbnails. In addition, it supports file merging, new file creation from styles such as lined, grid, graph and music sheet.
